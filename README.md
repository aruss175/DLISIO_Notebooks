# License and Use
I hope this work can be useful for any geoscientist working in academia, during a hackathon, or at a company dealing with subsurface well data.  I am a firm believer that file format parsing and file type conversions should not come at a cost in this day and age.

I can't promise the code is perfectly written, and as a non-professional developer, I appreciate all feedback.  Make an issue or change the code and submit a pull request!
